Distributed processing frameworks, such as Yahoo!’s Hadoop and Google’s MapReduce, have been successful at harnessing expansive datacenter resources for large-scale data analysis. However, their effect on datacenter energy efficiency has not been scrutinized. Moreover, the filesystem component of these frameworks effectively precludes scale-down of clusters deploying these frameworks (i.e. operating at reduced capacity). This paper presents our early work on modifying Hadoop to allow scale-down of operational clusters. We find that running Hadoop clusters in fractional configurations can save between 9% and 50% of energy consumption, and that there is a tradeoff between performance energy consumption. We also outline further research into the energy-efficiency of these frameworks.
