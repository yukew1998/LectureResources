We propose ASeD that uses the hardware resources of transactional memory systems for non transactional memory purpose. We show that the hardware components for register checkpointing, data versioning, and conflict detection can be reused as basic building blocks for reliability, security, and debugging support. Categories and Subject Descriptors: C.1.4 [Processor Architecture]: Parallel Architecture General Terms: Reliability, Security, Design Keywords: Transactional Memory, Reliability, Security, Debugging
