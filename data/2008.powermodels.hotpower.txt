several high-level full-system power models for a wide range of workloads and machines, and we compare the accuracy of these models in each instance. This analysis illuminates the trade-offs between simplicity and accuracy, as well as the limitations of each type of model. We begin with a discussion of previously proposed approaches to power modeling in Section 2, before defining the models compared in this work and describing the infrastructure used to generate them in Section 3. Section 4 then describes the software and hardware platforms used for their evaluation. Section 5 presents the results of the evaluation, which are discussed qualitatively in Section 6. Section 7 presents the overall conclusions and directions for future work.
