Finding a subset of users to statistically represent the original social network is a fundamental issue in Social Network Analysis (SNA). The problem has not been extensively studied in existing literature. In this paper, we present a formal definition of the problem of sampling representative users from social network. We propose two sampling models and theoretically prove their NP-hardness. To efficiently solve the two models, we present an efficient algorithm with provable approximation guarantees. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed models for sampling representative users significantly outperform (+6%-23% in terms of  *$† Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList) ‡ IBM, China Research Lab jietang@tsinghua.edu.cn, zh.sherlock@gmail.com, { caikeke, lizhang, suzhong } @cn.ibm.com     *$
